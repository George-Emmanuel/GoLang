# Go Language (Golang)

Go, often referred to as **Golang**, is an open-source programming language developed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It was designed to be simple, efficient, and reliable, with a focus on concurrency and scalability.

## Syntax Overview

### Hello World

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

### Variables

```go
var message string = "Hello"
age := 30 // Short variable declaration
```

### Functions

```go
func add(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

### Structs

```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```

### Interfaces

```go
type Reader interface {
    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```

## Concurrency in Go

Go's concurrency model is based on **goroutines** and **channels**.

### Goroutines

Lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime.

```go
go func() {
    fmt.Println("Running in a goroutine")
}()
```

### Channels

Used for communication between goroutines.

```go
ch := make(chan int)
go func() { ch <- 42 }()
value := <-ch
```

## Package Management

- **Go Modules** (since Go 1.11): Dependency management and versioning.
- `go mod init`, `go mod tidy`, `go get`

---

## Tooling

- `go build` â€” Compile packages and dependencies
- `go run` â€” Compile and run Go program
- `go test` â€” Run tests
- `go fmt` â€” Format code
- `go doc` â€” Show documentation

---

## Use Cases

- **Web Servers & APIs:** Fast, scalable backend services
- **Cloud Services:** Kubernetes, Docker are written in Go
- **DevOps Tools:** CLI tools, automation
- **Networking:** High-performance network servers
